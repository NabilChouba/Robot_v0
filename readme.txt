RobotV0
This is the first robot that I made ... from there come the name of the project RobotV0.
As I m working in NXP, I found Good idea to use the same Cortex M0 for hobby
registering on the NXP site I got free started kit LPC1114.

I m also using the :
  - Low cost robot chassis kit : Pololu Round.
  - Ping sensor to detect distance.
  - Pololu md08a as motor driver.
  - level shifter : 74HC4049.
  - 9V batteries and 2 LM to generate 3V and 5V.
